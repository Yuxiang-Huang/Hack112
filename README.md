# Hack112

Our program allows users to play Capture the Flag against a friend using their keyboard or AR. Enjoy the ocean wall and all the power-ups and obstacles we added!

## How to Run

Modules a user would need to run our program: playsound, Open-CV, and mediapipe.

To start our program, run main.py.
